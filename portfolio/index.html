<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mdealiaga/DSI-Capstone/blob/master/Capstone-Part-4.ipynb">Forecasting Bitcoin Price Using Twitter Sentiment Analysis</a>: A script that collects daily Bitcoin price and Tweets, performs NLP, runs a multivariate time-series model, and outputs the predicted price for the next day. [NLP, AWS EC2, AWS s3, Multivariate Time-Series, APIs]</li>

<li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mdealiaga/Job-Salary-Webscraping-and-Prediction/blob/master/Web%20Scraping%20Job%20Data.ipynb">Web Scraping and Salary Prediction on Indeed.com</a>: HTML scraping of salary information on data science jobs in Indeed.com using BeautifulSoup.

<p>Tools: scikit-learn, Textblob, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib,</p>

<h3 id="machinelearningreportsatlondonbusinessschoolusingxlminer">Machine Learning Reports at London Business School (Using XLMiner)</h3>

<p>Before learning to code, while at London Business School, I learned how to leverage Machine Learning techniques using XLMiner. Project reports are presented in PDF format.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/mdealiaga/Portfolio/blob/master/Data%20Mining%20LBS/Predicting%20Next%20Month%20views%20for%20BBC/Predicting%20Next%20Month%20views%20for%20BBC.pdf">Predicting Next Month views for BBC</a> Project assigned by Head of Data Science for BBC - Gabriel Straub. Performed customer segmentation analysis using clustering. Then predicted next month viewer metrics using logistic regression. [Clustering, Logistic Regression]</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/mdealiaga/Portfolio/blob/master/Data%20Mining%20LBS/Estimating%20Lending%20Club%20Probability%20of%20Default/Estimating%20Lending%20Club%20Probability%20of%20Default.pdf">Estimating Lending Club Probability of Default</a> Project estimating proability of default in a loan dataset. Cleaned data and used a logistic regression to locate bloans with best returns. [Interaction Terms, PCA, Logistic Regression]</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/mdealiaga/Portfolio/blob/master/Data%20Mining%20LBS/Predicting%20Risk%20of%20Cardiovascular%20Disease/Predicting%20Risk%20of%20Cardiovascular%20Disease.pdf">Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease:</a> Model determining whether a patient had cardiovascular disease based on patient data. The project focuses on analysing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, based on the costs of a wrong prediction. [Sentitivity Analysis, PCA, Logistic Regression]</p></li>
