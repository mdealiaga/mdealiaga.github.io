description: What I am and what I do.

During my Masters in Management at London Business School, I fell in love with the power of leveraging analytical techniques to obtain useful insights from data. I have interned at a digital healthcare startup as a data analyst and consultant, and have experience in the Fintech space. Having developed a great interest in Computer Science, Mathematics, and analytics, I chose to study Data Science at General Assembly. I am now looking to further improve my skills, with a focus on machine learning.
